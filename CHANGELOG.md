  is now included in the default config.
  All rules are on except ``no-nodejs-modules`` which depends on the env.
- Added: [``react/jsx-first-prop-new-line``](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/jsx-first-prop-new-line.md)
  with ``multiline`` value to enforce first prop on a new line if there is
  multiple props.  
  The following patterns are now considered warnings:

  ```js
  <Hello personal
      prop />
  ```

  ```js
  <Hello personal={true} />

  <Hello
      personal={true}
      foo="bar"
  />
  ```

  This rules requires that you accompany all ``target='_blank'`` attributes with
  ``rel='noreferrer noopener'``
  [for security reasons](https://mathiasbynens.github.io/rel-noopener/).
