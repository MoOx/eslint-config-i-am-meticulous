- Changed: eslint@3 compat

  - eslint-plugin-react@6

  [`eslint-plugin-import`](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import) is
  now included in the default config. All rules are on except
  `no-nodejs-modules` which depends on the env.

  [`react/jsx-first-prop-new-line`](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/jsx-first-prop-new-line.md)
  with `multiline` value to enforce first prop on a new line if there is
  multiple props. The following patterns are now considered warnings: multiple
  props. The following patterns are now considered warnings:

  ```js
  <Hello personal prop />
  ```

  The following patterns are now not considered warnings:

  ```js
  <Hello personal={true} />

  <Hello
      personal={true}
      foo="bar"
  />
  ```

- Added:
  [`react/jsx-no-target-blank`](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/jsx-no-target-blank.md).
  This rules requires that you accompany all `target='_blank'` attributes with
  `rel='noreferrer noopener'`
  [for security reasons](https://mathiasbynens.github.io/rel-noopener/).
